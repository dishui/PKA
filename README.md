This is a Pet Project for playing with ChromaDB and LangChain.
The first MVP is a simple Personal Knowledge Assistant. 

Even though it's a pet project, I'm going to try to make it close to production ready as possible.

## **ðŸŽ‰ What To Expect**

### **Solid Technical Foundation**

- **tech stack**: LangGraph + FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL/Redis + Llama 3.1 a modern, scalable combination
- **Cost-effective design**: Open-source components, avoiding API fees
- **RAG implementation**: Smart use of pgvector for semantic search over personal notes

### **Production-Quality Architecture:**

1. **Docker-First Development** - Everything containerized
2. **Clean Code Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript + Pydantic coverage
4. **Error Handling** - Custom exceptions and graceful failures
5. **Configuration Management** - Environment-based settings
6. **Health Checks** - Monitoring and observability
7. **Security Best Practices** - Non-root containers, CORS, validation
